  <h1>BIG ASS TITLE</h1>
<p>Tech-Farming business project that aims to help the people living in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) to undertake a more developed agricultural system so as to improve food production and this will eradicate the problem of food insecurity facing these areas. People living in such areas have been highly affected by drought and famine hence farming practices result into low or even no yields from the farms. This has caused over 4.2Million people in Kenya to suffer from food insecurity and severe poverty and even to an extend of causing several deaths.
